|Workload is spread over the whole team|3|[GitHub Link](https://github.com/mohitsoni2111/jobPortal/pulse)|
|Number of commits|3|[GitHub Link](https://github.com/mohitsoni2111/jobPortal)|
|Number of commits: by different people|3|[GitHub Link](https://github.com/mohitsoni2111/jobPortal/pulse)|
|Issues reports|3|[Issues](https://github.com/mohitsoni2111/jobPortal/issues)|
|DOI badge|3|[DOI Badge](https://zenodo.org/record/7150956#.Y0Ca2HbMJPY)|
|Docs: doco generated, format not ugly|3|[GitHub Link](./../documentation/)|
|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation)|3| In GitHub (before each class and function)|
|Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z|3| In README.md|
|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing|3|In README.md|
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.|3|In README.md|
|Use of version control tools|3|Using GitHub|
|Use of style checkers|3|Using [standard JS](https://standardjs.com/): evidence of installed module in [package.json](./../angular/app/package.json)|
|Use of code formatters|3|Using [Prettier](./../angular/app/.prettierrc.json) for front-end <br>Using Intellij IDEA using `ctrl + alt + J` for back-end|
|Use of syntax checkers|3|Using Intellij IDEA and VSCode|
|Use of code coverage|3|[Code coverage](https://app.codecov.io/gh/mohitsoni2111/jobPortal)|
|Other automated analysis tools|1|Used Jacoco plugin in maven for generating coverage reports|
|Test cases exist|3|[Tests](./../src/test)|
|Test cases are routinely executed|3|[GitHub actions](https://github.com/mohitsoni2111/jobPortal/actions)|

|Test cases: a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases|3|[GitHub Link](https://github.com/mohitsoni2111/jobPortal/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files|3||
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)|3|Multiple people working on files across the project Examples: [1](./../src/main/resources), [2](./../angular/app/src/app/login/login.component.ts), [3](../README.md), [4](./../src/main/java/edu/ncsu/group9/jobPortal/dao/UserDao.java)|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools(e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)|3||
|Evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base|2| Divided work between front-end and back-end|
|Short release cycles|2|[Releases](https://github.com/mohitsoni2111/jobPortal/releases)|
